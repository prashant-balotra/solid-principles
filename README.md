The SOLID principles are five foundational guidelines in object-oriented software design to create code that is more maintainable, flexible, and scalable. A project that follows these principles in Java will exhibit improved structure and easier adaptability. Below is an explanation of these principles and an outline for a sample Java project that applies them.

**SOLID Principles Overview**

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class should have only one purpose/responsibility, changing only for one reason.

- **Open-Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. New features should be added by extension rather than editing existing code.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without affecting program correctness.

- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** No class should be forced to implement interfaces/methods it does not use.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should rely on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
